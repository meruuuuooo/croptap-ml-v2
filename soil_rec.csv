"Common Name","Soil Requirement"
"Coconut","Rich, alluvium, loam or lateritic loamy soils are best suited; tolerates a certain degree of alkalinity so it is found along coastal strips; moving water table is favorable, while stagnant water as well as heavy clay should be avoided; requires high light intensity. Needs uniform rainfall and away from typhoon belts."
"Coffee","Deep, well-drained loam rich in nutrients especially potash with good amount of humus is best. It needs shade trees or grass or organic litter as mulch to cover ground is desirable to protect the physical structure of the soil and nutrients from rain. It grows best in rolling sloping, well-drained lands of volcanic origin rich in organic matter."

"Gabi","Fertile, sandy loam soil, with sufficient amount of water during growing period."
"Garlic","Fertile, well-drained loamy soils."
"Ginger","Prefers light but rich loose soils with good drainage. Heavy soils give reduced yield."

"Lucerne","Grows best on well-drained light or medium-textured soils with high calcium content; it thrives even on shallow soils which are often stony. Can survive long droughts."
"Mango","Grows best on rich, deep alluvial loams with good drainage; flourishes on most soils which are not too shallow; high nitrogen content combined with uniform distribution of rainfall or a regular supply of water from water table and uniform high temperature result in non-bearing trees."
"Millet","Well-drained, light to medium textured soils; more resistant to drought than corn."
"Mongo","Light to medium-textured soils with good aeration are best suited."
"Muskmelon","Loamy or alluvial soils rich in organic matter and well-drained."

"Okra","Fertile, well-drained sandy loam and clay loam soils."
"Onion, Bulb","Fertile, well-drained sandy loam or alluvial soil."
"Orange","Fine sandy loam or deep, loose, well-aerated soils free from stagnant water to a depth of 6 ft."
"Palm, Date","Flourishes on clay as well as sand; it can tolerate 1-3 per cent salt content (organic manures or residues to cover soil surface reduces salt concentrations at the soil surface.)"
"Papaya","Does best on well-drained, deep soils; it can not tolerate water-logging and soil compaction; it reacts well to a good supply of farm manure, compost or green manures."
"Parsnip","Heavy soil neutral in pH or reaction."
"Patani (Lima Bean)","See bean, lima."
"Patola","Well-drained loamy soil or alluvial soil rich in organic matter."
"Peanut","Well-drained aerated soils with adequate water holding capacity like sandy loam are very suitable."

"Pepper, Sweet","Well-drained light to medium textured soils."
"Pepper, Black","Well-drained light to medium-textured soils rich in organic matter."
"Pineapple","Well-drained and aerated light to moderately heavy soil with good amount of organic matter are best; heavy soils in regions of high rainfall should be on gentle slopes; calcium content of the soil must be high; calcareous soils are not suitable owing to development of calcium chlorosis due to lack of iron."
"Potatoes","Well-aerated sandy loams; good crop produced from deep, rich, well-drained friable clay, silt or sandy loam. Above pH 6.0, it is liable to suffer from scab. pH of soils must be 5.3 or 5.5; controlled by application of sulfur in the row."

"Tapilan","Thrives well on light to medium-textured well-aerated soils."
"Tea","Thrives well on light to medium-textured well-aerated soils."
"Tobacco","According to variety, well-drained light to heavy soils, with good water supply are suitable; above pH 6.0, tobacco is often attacked by 'black-root-rot', while below pH 4.5, manganese toxicity can be a problem, about 2 per cent of chlorides in fertilizer mixture is used to improve yield, color, combustibility, and elasticity of tobacco. Sulfate form of potash is good for improving quality and combustibility."
